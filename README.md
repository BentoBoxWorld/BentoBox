BentoBox is an expandable Minecraft Bukkit plugin for island-type games like SkyBlock or AcidIsland.
Admins can assemble the game or games how they like with a variety of add-ons. These include:

* BSkyBlock - the successor to the popular ASkyBlock. Don't fall!
* AcidIsland - you are marooned in a sea of acid!
* Level - an add-on to calculate your island level and show a top ten
* Challenges - an add-on that gives you challenges to accomplish
* Welcome WarpSigns - an add-on that enables players to plant a warp sign

Bentobox represents a turning point on ASkyBlock's history : Tastybento and Poslovitch thought up and designed this complete rewrite in order to provide a whole new way to play Skyblock and other island-style games.

Hereby, **you** and **only you** are wrong when you :
* insist that we should fix a bug within an irrational period of time;
* behave rudely;
* are asking for support whereas solutions have already been given or are easily accessible;
