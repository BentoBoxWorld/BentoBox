BentoBox is an expandable Minecraft **plugin** for island-type games like SkyBlock or AcidIsland.

## About BentoBox

### History

ASkyBlock and AcidIsland were originally created by [tastybento](https://github.com/tastybento).
These two plugins were sharing the same codebase, which grew fastly but ultimately became hard to maintain.
[Poslovitch](https://github.com/Poslovitch) was running a Skyblock server before starting to contribute regularly on ASkyBlock's codebase.

Then came the idea of *completely rewriting ASkyBlock*.
A turning point that would be called *BSkyBlock*.
In May 2017, tastybento agreed to the idea, and Poslovitch and him spent more time developing the code of the plugin which would become *BentoBox*.
During summer 2018, ASkyBlock's support got dropped and development was focused on the now called plugin *BentoBox*, which would then take over ASkyBlock and AcidIsland for 1.13+ servers.

### Description

BentoBox introduces a **unique Addon system** and a **powerful API** which allows for a technically **unlimited customization** of the gamemodes.
Therefore, BentoBox **does nothing on its own**: addons and gamemodes are bringing the features.

BentoBox being totally **free and open-sourced**, we are confident in seeing this platform grow and become even more powerful in the future.

Start now to create the server you've dreamed of!
