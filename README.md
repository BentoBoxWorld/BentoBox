BentoBox is an expandable Minecraft Bukkit plugin for island-type games like ASkyBlock or AcidIsland.
Admins can assemble the game or games how they like with a variety of add-ons. These include:

BSkyBlock - the successor to the popular ASkyBlock. Don't fall!
AcidIsland - you are marooned in a sea of acid!
Level - an add-on to calculate your island level and show a top ten
Challenges - an add-on that gives you challenges to accomplish
Welcome WarpSigns - an add-on that enables players to plant a warp sign

Bentobox represents a turning point on ASkyBlock's history : Tastybento and Poslovitch thought and designed together this complete rewrite in order to provide a whole new way to play Skyblock.

**Discover today BSkyBlock, its gameplay overhaul, and enjoy the Skyblock revival!**
