# BentoBox Configuration 1.4.0
# This config file is dynamic and is updated right after BentoBox loaded its settings from it.
# You can edit it while the server is online and you can do '/bbox reload' to take the changes into account.
# However, it is a better practice to edit this file while the server is offline.
general:
  # Default language for new players.
  # This is the filename in the locale folder without .yml.
  # If this does not exist, the default en-US will be used.
  default-language: en-US
  # Use economy or not. If true, an economy plugin is required. If false, no money is used or give.
  # If there is no economy plugin present anyway, money will be automatically disabled.
  use-economy: true
  database:
    # YAML, JSON, MYSQL, MARIADB (10.2.3+), MONGODB.
    # YAML and JSON are both file-based databases.
    # MYSQL might not work with all implementations: if available, use a dedicated database type (e.g. MARIADB).
    # If you use MONGODB, you must also run the BSBMongo plugin (not addon).
    # See https://github.com/tastybento/bsbMongo/releases/.
    # /!\ BentoBox currently does not support changing this value mid-game. If you do need to change it, do a full reset of your databases and worlds.

  # Allow FTB Autonomous Activator to work (will allow a pseudo player [CoFH] to place and break blocks and hang items)

logs:
  # Toggle whether superflat chunks regeneration should be logged in the server logs or not.
  # It can be spammy if there are a lot of superflat chunks to regenerate.
  # However, as superflat chunks regeneration can be performance-intensive, it is recommended to keep
  # this setting set to true, as it will help you know if there are regenerations taking place.
  # Added since 1.2.0.

    time:
