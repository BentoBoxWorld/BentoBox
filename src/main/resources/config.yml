# BentoBox Configuration 0.12.0-SNAPSHOT
# This config file is dynamic and saved when the server is shutdown.
# You cannot edit it while the server is running because changes will
# be lost! Use in-game settings GUI or edit when server is offline.
general:
  # BentoBox uses bStats.org to get global data about the plugin to help improving it.
  # bStats has nearly no effect on your server's performance and the sent data is completely
  # anonymous so please consider twice if you really want to disable it.
  metrics: true
  # Default language for new players.
  # This is the filename in the locale folder without .yml.
  # If this does not exist, the default en-US will be used.

  # Use economy or not. If true, an economy plugin is required. If false, no money is used or give.
  # If there is no economy plugin present anyway, money will be automatically disabled.

  # Starting money - this is how much money new players will have as their
  # balance at the start of an island.
