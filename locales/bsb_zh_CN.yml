      在此插件能正常运作之前, 您需要更多设置...
      请编辑 config.yml, 然后重启服务器.
  distance: "确保您已设定过岛屿距离. 若要升级, 请设为原值."
  generator: |-
      岛屿世界生成器注册失败.
      可能的潜在原因:
        1. 若您将岛屿世界作为服务器的唯一世界
           确保您已将此世界添加到 bukkit.yml 中.
        2. 您重载了服务器而并未重启. 请重启服务器重试.
  generator-multiverse: "  3. 您的 Multiverse 插件已过期. 请升级到最新版本."
  world-name: |-
      config.yml 中的世界名与 islands.yml 中的世界名不符.
      若您这样做是有目的的, 系统将假设您想完全重设岛屿世界.
      若是, 请删除 islands.yml 和原世界.
      若否, 请修正 config.yml 中的世界名并重启. 若您正在升级, 您很可能是这种情况.
  config-outdated: |-
      config.yml 似乎已过期.
      请核实您的配置文件是否经过更新.
      若此错误持续出现, 您很可能是编辑了旧的配置文件, 而非新的配置文件.
      如果是这样, 请删除当前的 config.yml, 参照 config.new.yml 创建一个新的 config.yml.
