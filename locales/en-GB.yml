not-setup:
  header: |-
      More set up is required before the plugin can start...
      Edit config.yml. Then restart server.
  distance: "Make sure you set island distance. If upgrading, set it to what it was before."
  generator: |-
      The world generator for the island world is not registered.
      Potential reasons are:
        1. If you are configuring the island world as the only server world
           Make sure you have added the world to bukkit.yml
        2. You reloaded instead of restarting the server. Reboot and try again.
  generator-multiverse: "  3. Your Multiverse plugin is out of date. Upgrade to the latest version."
  world-name: |-
      The world name in config.yml is different to the world name in islands.yml.
      If this is intentional, we assume you are doing a full reset.
      If so, delete islands.yml and the previous world.
      If not, correct the world name in config.yml and restart. This is probably the case if you are upgrading.
  config-outdated: |-
      The config.yml file looks outdated.
      Make sure you updated your configuration after upgrading.
      If this error is still happening, you probably edited the old config rather than editing the new one.
      If so, please remove the current config.yml, work on config.new.yml and rename it to config.yml.

general:
  success: "Success!"
  errors:
    no-permission: "You don't have permission to execute this command."
